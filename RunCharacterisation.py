#  Before running this characterisation, check that correct line & point are defined in first 2 files
#  Whole thing takes around 16 hours
#  After running this characterisation, run the matlab command:

# VARIABLENAMEHERE = SensorState('rand', 5000, 'rep', 100, 'line', 100);

# Which creates object (save this!) & filters all the data: takes 5/10 minutes
